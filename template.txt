# This is a template of how you can feed audio and images and I generate videos
# Any line starting with a '#' will be ignored so all of this is just instructional text
# Similar to how you send emails previously, Example:
# Song: Rim Jhim Gire Sawan
# Film: Manzil
# Singers (Original): Kishore Kumar
# Singers (Karaoke): Ravi Shankar Kolathur
#
# I want to also add 2 more fields, these will not be included in the video but are for me
# One is the Singer Images and the other is a Poster Image
# Singer Images will be a comma seperated list of images you want to use.
# For singer images, when you are adding a new image just attach it to the email along with template
# You and I will have a folder of singer images that are syncronized and so we will be using the same images
# Please look at the zip file sent along with this email for the singer images folder, to seed this.
# Poster Image is a link to the image from online for the movie poster
# Please try to find images that are large, above 500x500, that usually ends up looking better
# The following is an example for one of your songs
